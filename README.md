# food-order-app 
This is a food order app project that I developed for educational purposes. The project is designed to showcase the usage of various React hooks, including <b> useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, useCallback, </b> and <b> useRef </b>.

# Purpose
The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of React concepts and strengthen my proficiency in web development using React. By building this food order app, I aimed to apply the theoretical knowledge I gained from learning about different hooks in a practical context.
# Learning Outcome
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with React hooks, managing component state, and developing interactive user interfaces. This project allowed me to practice creating functional components, managing component lifecycles, and handling user interactions effectively.
